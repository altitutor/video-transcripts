00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.400
okay so we are done with all of the calculus we&nbsp;
need to learn this year the last three topics are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.360
all going to be looking at statistics and in this&nbsp;
one we're looking at discrete random variables&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.760
let's start by talking about what a discrete&nbsp;
random variable actually is in statistics we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.520
have these things called random variables which we&nbsp;
denote with capital letters so for example X could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.400
be a random variable and then y could be another&nbsp;
random variable a random variable is just anything&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:43.240
which can change so let's say we Define the random&nbsp;
variable X as the number of rainy days this week&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:50.640
then X could take any value between 0 and 7 so&nbsp;
for example if it rained on Monday and Tuesday&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.400
this week then X would equal 2 but the next week&nbsp;
it could rain on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:06.360
X would equal 3 we can separate random variables&nbsp;
into two main types discrete random variables and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.360
continuous random variables the main difference&nbsp;
between these is that discrete random variables&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:22.320
can only take specific set values for example&nbsp;
the number of people in a room so there could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.440
be 1 2 three or four people in a room but there&nbsp;
can't be two and a half people in a room so this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:38.000
random variable can only take set values which&nbsp;
are whole numbers on the other hand continuous&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:47.040
random variables can take any value within a&nbsp;
range for example the height of a student this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.040 --> 00:02:00.600
could be 170 cm 171 cm but it could also be 170.5&nbsp;
or 172.5 because I can continue adding an infinite&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:08.080
number of decimal places onto the end the random&nbsp;
variable can take any value within the range and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.320
therefore it's a continuous random variable we&nbsp;
say that discrete random variables are variables&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:24.520
we can count whereas continuous random variables&nbsp;
are variables that we measure okay just so we get&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:32.280
this idea in our head let's go through a couple of&nbsp;
examples so the example we gave before where X was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:39.400
the number of rainy days in one week that would&nbsp;
be a discrete random variable because X could&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:48.800
only equal 0 1 2 3 all the way up to 7 it cannot&nbsp;
equal 2.5 for example let's do these four as well&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:57.960
a test score out of 40 would be a discrete random&nbsp;
variable because it can only equal 1 2 or 3 up to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:06.760
40 some test you may be able to get 1.5 or 1.75&nbsp;
but it's unlikely that there are any more decimals&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:14.960
that can be added to that so it's still a discrete&nbsp;
random variable the volume of water in a bottle is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:22.400
something we measure it can take any value within&nbsp;
a range so it's a continuous random variable same&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:29.160
with the weight of an apple we measure it so it's&nbsp;
a continuous random variable and finally the value&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:37.520
on the top of a dice when you roll it that can&nbsp;
only be 1 2 3 4 5 or 6 so it's a discrete random&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:45.440
variable the first thing we're going to learn&nbsp;
about discrete random variables is how to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.240
these things called probability distributions&nbsp;
so let's just look at this spinner on the top&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:00.360
left as we can see there are eight evenly spaced&nbsp;
spaces and they each have a different number on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:09.000
them so if I spin this spinner there is an equal&nbsp;
chance that this Arrow would land up on any of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.640
spaces therefore we can define a random variable&nbsp;
X where X is the number displayed on the spinner&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:26.720
so to do this we write let x equal the number&nbsp;
on the spinner hopefully we can see that X is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:37.120
a random variable which has possible values 1 2 3&nbsp;
or 4 we can find the probability distribution for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:47.360
X which is the chance that x equals each of its&nbsp;
possible values so we write P that X is equal to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:56.280
1 this means the probability that the random&nbsp;
variable X is equal to one now to calculate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:05.160
this there are three spaces labeled one out of&nbsp;
of a total 8 so this probability that xal 1 is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:12.640
equal to 3 8 let's do the same thing for each&nbsp;
of the other values so we have the probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:21.240
that X is equal to 2 and there are two spaces&nbsp;
labeled 2 out of 8 so that probability is 2 8&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:32.080
the probability that X is equal to 3 is 1 on&nbsp;
8 and then the probability that X is = 4 is 2&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:41.880
8 so this here is the probability distribution&nbsp;
of this random variable X it shows us each of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:49.360
the possible values of X and the probability&nbsp;
that X takes each of those values instead of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:56.480
writing this probability distribution as separate&nbsp;
statements we can instead display it in a table&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:03.880
like this so on the top we have have a little&nbsp;
X which represents the possible values of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:13.600
random variable so these are 1 2 3 and four and on&nbsp;
the bottom row we have the probability that X is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:23.080
equal to each of these values so the probability&nbsp;
that X was 1 was 3 8 the probability that X was 2&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:31.680
was 2 8 and then so on this is just an easier way&nbsp;
to display probability distributions and it's what&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:38.480
we're going to be working with from now notice&nbsp;
one thing about this distribution that these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:47.360
probabilities here all of them add up to a value&nbsp;
of 8 over 8 which is equal to one this should make&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:56.840
sense because the probability of at least one&nbsp;
of these happening is 100% or one so one fact&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:05.040
we need to know about probability distribution is&nbsp;
that in any probability distribution the sum of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:12.200
all of the probabilities is going to be equal to&nbsp;
1 this symbol here is the Greek letter Sigma and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:20.440
it means sum so this just says the sum of all&nbsp;
probabilities has to equal one let's do these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:28.160
three questions on the bottom of the page so for&nbsp;
this probability distribution over here let's find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:37.000
the probability that X is equal 2 or 1 to find&nbsp;
this we just add the two individual values p x = 2&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:48.440
is 2 8 and PX = 1 is 3 8 so the total probability&nbsp;
is 5 8 this means that the total probability of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:56.880
getting either a 1 or a 2 is 5 8 for the next&nbsp;
question we have to find the probability that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:03.880
X is greater than 1 you using this table we can&nbsp;
interpret that that means that the probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:12.920
that X is equal to 2 3 or four because these are&nbsp;
all greater than one to find this probability we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:25.320
add up these three probabilities so that's&nbsp;
2 8 + 1 8 + 2 8 which is 5 8 part C says if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:34.600
the probability that X is less than or equal to&nbsp;
an unknown value K is greater than 0.5 find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:43.320
minimum value of K now this probability statement&nbsp;
is a little bit hard to understand at first and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:50.200
if we don't get exactly what it means then the&nbsp;
easiest way to do this question is just through&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:58.560
trial and error so we want the minimum value of&nbsp;
K and therefore let's start from the bottom of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:06.600
the probability distribution in other words&nbsp;
K is equal to 1 so if K was equal to 1 Let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:13.920
substitute that into this probability statement&nbsp;
which should make it easier to understand we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:20.920
the probability that X is less than or equal&nbsp;
to 1 well we know how to calculate that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:28.320
probability that X is less than or equal to one&nbsp;
has possible values only one because that's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:36.280
only number here here which is less than or equal&nbsp;
to 1 so therefore that probability is just 3 8 we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:44.400
can see that this is not yet greater than 0.5&nbsp;
so this is not the correct answer let's try the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:52.840
next value of K if K is equal to 2 substitute&nbsp;
it into this probability statement we get the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:52.840 --> 00:10:00.880
probability that X is less than or equal to 2 so&nbsp;
hopefully we can see that what this means is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:08.800
X can equal 1 or two because both of these are&nbsp;
less than or equal to two this probability is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:18.720
2 on 8 + 3 / 8 which is 5 8 and we can see that&nbsp;
this fulfils the criteria of being greater than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:28.040
0.5 5 8 is greater than 0.5 so therefore the&nbsp;
minimum value of K which makes this statement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:37.120
true is is K is equal to 2 let's have a go at&nbsp;
a few example questions involving probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:44.000
distributions for the one on the left we have a&nbsp;
probability distribution and the first thing we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.360
need to do is find this unknown K remember what we&nbsp;
said on the last Slide the most important thing to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:58.160
remember about all probability distributions&nbsp;
is that when you add all the probabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:05.840
together they a have to equal 1 so we can use&nbsp;
this to find the unknown K putting this into an&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:18.240
equation gives us 0.1 + 0.25 + 0.3 + 0.15 + K is&nbsp;
equal to 1 notice how we just added together all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:24.560
the probabilities and they have to add up to&nbsp;
one then we can just solve this equation 4 K&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:34.680
adding these numbers on the left gives us 0.8 + K&nbsp;
is equal 1 and therefore K is equal to 0.2 Part B&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:44.240
says given the probability X is greater than or&nbsp;
equal to an unknown number B is greater than 0.3&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:51.200
find the maximum value of B so remember how we&nbsp;
approached these ones again we just want to use&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:57.760
trial and error to make it easier to understand&nbsp;
so because we want the maximum value we are going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:05.080
to start with the high highest value which is 1&nbsp;
so we say if B is equal to 1 and then sub it into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:12.840
the probability this gives us the probability&nbsp;
that X is greater than or equal to 1 now we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:23.160
calculate this so if x is greater than or equal&nbsp;
to 1 the only value it can be is 1 and therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:34.040
the probability is just K so this probability&nbsp;
is equal to 0.2 now 0.2 is not greater than 0.3&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:40.840
so because this probability doesn't fulfill&nbsp;
the criteria then B is not equal to one and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:51.000
we try the next value down so if B is equal to 0&nbsp;
sub it in P that X is greater than or equal to 0&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:59.400
this time for X to be greater than or equal to 0&nbsp;
x could be 0 or 1 and therefore this probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:11.800
is 0.15 + 0.2 which is 0.35 so this is greater&nbsp;
than 0.3 and therefore the maximum value of B to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:20.320
fulfill that criteria is B is equal to Z let's&nbsp;
try the question on the right now so we've got&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:26.480
another probability distribution and we need to&nbsp;
find a we're going to do this in the same way as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:34.320
the previous question so we add the probabilities&nbsp;
and set it equal to 1 adding up these A's on the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:46.080
left hand side we have 3 a + 2 a is 5 a and then&nbsp;
add another a on 2 this gives us 11 a / 2 then we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:56.400
can subtract the 0.1 to the other side equals 0.9&nbsp;
and therefore a is equal to 1.8 over 11 then for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:06.240
Part B we want the probability that X is between&nbsp;
1 and 4 now for this to occur the possible values&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:15.680
of X are two or three so therefore we can find the&nbsp;
probability by adding up these two probabilities&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:28.680
this gives us 3 * 1.8 11 + 2 * 1.8 11 which&nbsp;
I can put into my calculator to get 9 over 11

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:38.200
okay so apart from probability distributions the&nbsp;
other thing we need to know about is probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:46.480
distribution functions a probability distribution&nbsp;
function looks like this here we have a function&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:56.360
containing X and then a list of possible values&nbsp;
of X and this is essentially the same thing as a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:03.240
probability distribution table it's just that&nbsp;
to get the probability that xal 1 for example&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:12.920
we would need to take one and sub it into the&nbsp;
function so P that x = 1 is 1^ 2 + 1 34 which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:20.680
is 2 34 another example just so we get it if&nbsp;
we wanted to calculate the probability that X&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:32.240
is equal to 2 we would sub 2 into the function so&nbsp;
2^ 2 + 1 34 is 5 4 essentially we could turn this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:39.120
probability distribution function into a regular&nbsp;
probability distribution table by just subbing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:45.920
each of the values in so we've got X the possible&nbsp;
values of X on the top and the probability of each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:54.120
of them on the bottom so the possible values of X&nbsp;
are listed here they are 1 2 3 and four and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:54.120 --> 00:16:00.240
the probabilities are found by subbing each of&nbsp;
these numbers into the function so this gives us&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:13.800
2 on 34 5 on 34 10 on 34 and 17 on 34 as you might&nbsp;
have noticed not all functions can be probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:21.520
distribution functions because when a probability&nbsp;
distribution function is transformed into a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:28.120
probability distribution table it still has to&nbsp;
fulfill the criteria of a probability distribution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:36.680
table so remember that was that all of these&nbsp;
probabilities have to add to one so therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:44.280
the first criteria a function must fulfill to be&nbsp;
a probability distribution function is that all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:55.440
values of P of X must add to one we can write this&nbsp;
as the sum of P of x i has to equal one where this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:02.960
little I is just a placeholder which signifies&nbsp;
that we are subbing in each of these values of X&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:10.400
the second condition a function must hold to to&nbsp;
be a probability distribution function is each&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:18.240
individual value of P of X must be positive we&nbsp;
can write this as P of X has to be greater than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:31.000
or equal to Zer for example if I had a function&nbsp;
P of X is equal tox / 6 for x is equal to 0 1 or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:38.400
2 this could not be a probability distribution&nbsp;
function because for example P of 1 is - 1 on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:46.800
6 and we can't have a negative probability so&nbsp;
if we want to prove a function is a probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:53.320
distribution function we just need to show that&nbsp;
it adheres to both of these conditions so let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:53.320 --> 00:18:03.960
do a few example questions this one says show that&nbsp;
this function here for x = 1 2 3 or 4 is a valid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:10.880
probability distribution function so to show this&nbsp;
remember that we need to show it fulfills the two&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:19.040
criteria the first was that all of the values of&nbsp;
the probability distribution function must add to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:25.960
one so we can prove this by finding each of the&nbsp;
values and adding them up this is the probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:36.920
that x = 1 plus p that x = 2 plus P that x = 3&nbsp;
plus the P that x = 4 to find this we just have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:44.680
to sub each of these numbers into the function&nbsp;
so the first one would be 1^ 2 + 1 34 which is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:50.280
2 over 34 this is the same function we looked at&nbsp;
in the last Slide by the way so I'm just going to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:50.280 --> 00:19:01.240
do this one a bit quicker P that x = 2 is 5 34&nbsp;
P that x = 3 is 10 on 34 and then P that x = 4&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:12.400
is 17 on 34 adding these numbers together 2 + 5&nbsp;
+ 10 + 17 is 34 over 34 which is 1 so therefore&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:18.880
we've fulfilled the first criteria we also need&nbsp;
to fulfill the second criteria which is that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:26.360
each individual value of P of X is positive so&nbsp;
because we've already found all of them we can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:34.080
just state that each of them are great than 0 and&nbsp;
therefore each individual value of the probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:41.200
distribution function is greater than zero so&nbsp;
because we've fulfilled the two criteria this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:47.760
function is a probability distribution function&nbsp;
let's do another question the one on the left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:56.400
says for this probability distribution function&nbsp;
x = 1 2 or 3 find the value of K so we can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:02.160
we've got an unknown K in the function function&nbsp;
but we can use the properties of a probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:09.640
distribution function to find K the first property&nbsp;
was that all of the values of the probability must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:17.800
add to one in other words the probability that x&nbsp;
equal 1 plus the probability that x = 2 plus the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:25.280
probability that x = 3 has to add up to 1 so we&nbsp;
can find each of these probabilities by subbing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:37.320
them into the function this gives us k * 1 2 +&nbsp;
K * 2 2 + K * 3 2 and then we can solve for K so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.840
the easiest way to do this would be to factor k&nbsp;
out and then we add the numbers in the brackets&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:51.800
so we've got 1^ 2 + 2 2 which is 4 + 3 2 which is&nbsp;
9 and then we get k equals and divide this whole&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:51.800 --> 00:21:01.760
thing in the brackets over to the other side so 1&nbsp;
+ 4 + 9 is 14 and then therefore K is 1/4 for the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:08.560
question on the right we're given a probability&nbsp;
distribution table and we need to find a function&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:15.320
which fits that table so this is kind of like&nbsp;
making a conjecture we basically want to come&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:21.720
up with a function such that when we Sub in one&nbsp;
we get this when we Sub in two we get this and so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:30.160
on so we start this by writing down everything in&nbsp;
the probabilities that is the same we can see that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:37.520
they're all over 16 so therefore the probability&nbsp;
distribution function has got to contain something&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:45.280
over 16 then we look at the thing which is&nbsp;
different every time so 1 3 5 and seven and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:52.840
ask how can I get from this number to this number&nbsp;
we can see that it increases by two every time so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:52.840 --> 00:22:02.480
plus 2 + 2 + 2 and therefore the formula must&nbsp;
contain Ain a 2X if we take for example 2 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:10.800
we calculate 2x that would give us 4 then to get&nbsp;
back to three we have to do min-1 so at least for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:18.440
this one the formula is 2x - 1 we just need to&nbsp;
check that it works for the rest so 2 * 3 is 6&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:28.400
6 - 1 is 5 2 4 8 - 1 is 7 and 2 1's 2 - 1 is 1&nbsp;
so therefore this formula works for subbing in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:34.960
each of these X values to get that probability if&nbsp;
that was a bit confusing these questions are much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:41.760
rarer and they don't come up in tests too much so&nbsp;
I wouldn't really worried about it and that is all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:48.600
we need to know about probability distributions&nbsp;
so far so after watching this video you should be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:54.760
able to do the following things firstly solve&nbsp;
problems involving probability distribution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:01.960
tables then we need to know the two conditions&nbsp;
for a probability distribution function remember&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:07.280
those were that the probabilities have to add&nbsp;
to one and each individual probability must&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:12.720
be positive we need to be able to calculate&nbsp;
probabilities using probability distribution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:19.720
functions remember we did that by just subbing in&nbsp;
the x value into the function and finally we need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:27.000
to be able to find unknowns inside probability&nbsp;
distribution functions in the next video we'll&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:35.680
look at calcula the mean median mode variance and&nbsp;
standard deviation of a probability distribution
