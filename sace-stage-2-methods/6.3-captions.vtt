00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:05.840
in this video we're going to continue looking at&nbsp;
the normal distribution but in this case we're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:12.880
learning about quantiles so let's say we have a&nbsp;
random variable X which is normally distributed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:20.800
with mean 10 and standard deviation 2 we can plot&nbsp;
the mean on the graph here let's say that we were&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:30.000
given this information the probability that X is&nbsp;
greater than some unknown value K is equal to 30%&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.240
or 0.3 we need to find the value of K to make this&nbsp;
clearer let's draw this on the graph so we know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:47.160
that the probability that X is greater than K is&nbsp;
30% therefore the area that we should shade should&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.920
start from this top end because all of these top&nbsp;
values are definitely going to be greater than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.200
K so what I do is I start shading from the top&nbsp;
side and when my area has reached approximately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:10.920
30% I'll stop and label this area as 0.3 remember&nbsp;
that the whole area under the curve is 100% or one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:18.240
therefore this value must be K we can see that&nbsp;
this represents the probability statement the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.920
probability or the area above K is 30% so we can&nbsp;
see this is quite similar to the previous normal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:34.040
distribution questions we were doing except in&nbsp;
this case we are given the area and we need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.200
find the value before we were given the value&nbsp;
and we needed to find the area we can do this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.120
in our calculator remember that for all normal&nbsp;
distribution questions we're going to be in stat&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:55.160
mode and then distribution normal remember that we&nbsp;
use NCD when we are given the values and we need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:02.200
to find the probability or the area and we use&nbsp;
inverse Norm normal when we are given the area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.640
or the probability and we need to find the values&nbsp;
so in this case we're going to be using inverse&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:16.480
normal we first put in our mean which is 10 and&nbsp;
then our standard deviation which is two the area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.080
is this value right here or the probability&nbsp;
which we input as 0.3 then we need to set the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.120
tail the tail is which way this thing here points&nbsp;
so you can see that it's pointing to the right so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:37.120
we set tail on the right side obviously if it was&nbsp;
pointing to this side we would set tail left tail&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.440
Central is used when the area is symmetrically&nbsp;
concentrated around the mean so to make that clear&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.320
here's a diagram we have to have the mean here&nbsp;
and then this value here K be the same as this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.160
value K and in that case we use a central tail&nbsp;
you can see that the area is in the middle but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.800
really importantly it has to be symmetrical around&nbsp;
the mean for this to work so anyway in this case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:13.320
we press tail right and then execute and this&nbsp;
gives us an x value of 11.05 therefore we know&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:22.560
that K is equal to 11.05 we can check this makes&nbsp;
sense using our diagram as we can see K is above&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.080
the mean which is 10 which fits with the value&nbsp;
of K which would be about here on a number line&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:35.520
let's try an example question exam marks are&nbsp;
normally distributed at this point I'll write&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:43.560
let x equal the exam marks we know that the mode&nbsp;
is 45 and standard deviation 20 so let's define&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.960
the distribution X is approximately normally&nbsp;
distributed now we don't know the mean but we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:57.080
know the mode and for normal distributions the&nbsp;
mean and the mode are the same so the mean is 45&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:05.120
and the standard deviation is 20 5% of students&nbsp;
score above x marks we need to write this out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:14.840
as a probability statement so the probability&nbsp;
that X is above Little X so greater than x is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:24.600
5% so this probability is equal to 0.05 you can&nbsp;
see that in this case we are given a probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:33.000
and we need to find the value so let's now draw&nbsp;
the distribution the mean is 45 and we want the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.120
probability that it is greater than a value to&nbsp;
be 5% so if we're using the greater than sign I'm&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.080
going to start shading from the top because these&nbsp;
values are going to be greater than and then when&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:54.760
I reach an area of about 5% of stop label that&nbsp;
as 0.05 and that value must be X now to calculate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:00.720
this value we use inverse normal in our calculator&nbsp;
and putting these values into to our calculator&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:09.680
gives us X is approximately equal to 77.9 let's&nbsp;
do another one city to Bay Running times are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.600
normally distributed let's define the variable let&nbsp;
x equal the city to Bay running time by the way if&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.440
you're struggling to know what to write here just&nbsp;
think what is normally distributed so whatever the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.800
question says is normally distributed that's&nbsp;
what you put here we know the mean is 73 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.240
the standard deviation is 10 so let's define&nbsp;
the distribution X is approximately normally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:44.440
distributed with mean 73 and standard deviation&nbsp;
10 will is faster than 98% of entrance in other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:52.440
words his time is in the top 2% find the slowest&nbsp;
possible time he could run let's try writing this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:59.520
out as a probability statement so we need to find&nbsp;
the time and therefore we don't know the value so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.960
so we might initially be tempted to write the&nbsp;
probability that X is greater than an unknown&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:14.840
value K is equal to 0.02 but this actually doesn't&nbsp;
make sense because if Will's time is greater than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:22.160
K it means that he's going to be running slower&nbsp;
than K right because if you take more time to run&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.160
you're running slower so actually in this case&nbsp;
it should be the probability that X is less than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:37.280
K is equal to0 .02 let's draw this out we have&nbsp;
the probability that X is less than K is 02 so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:45.360
therefore we start shading from the bottom until&nbsp;
we reach an area of about 2% label that 0.02 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.720
then that must be our value K hopefully looking&nbsp;
at this diagram makes a lot more sense we can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:59.920
that his time must be in the bottom 2% of times&nbsp;
for him to be faster than 98% of people by the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:06.600
way we could have also done this by writing the&nbsp;
probability that X is greater than K is 0.98 that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:12.160
would give us the same value in our calculator&nbsp;
we're going to use inverse normal because we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:18.920
have the area and we're finding the value the&nbsp;
tail is on the left with an area of 02 then we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:25.840
put the mean and standard deviation in and this&nbsp;
gives us a value of K is approximately equal to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:36.960
52.6 so therefore will must Run in under 52.4&nbsp;
minutes let's try another question to do with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.800
quants we know that the weight of Chip packets&nbsp;
is normally distributed with this mean and this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:51.360
standard deviation so let's define the variable&nbsp;
let x equal weight of Chip packets we know that X&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:51.360 --> 00:08:00.840
is normally distributed with mean 250 and standard&nbsp;
deviation 4 now the advertised weight is 250 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:08.200
if the actual weight is more than k grams of this&nbsp;
meaning k grams above or k grams below they are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:15.840
discarded we know that 2% are discarded, find K so&nbsp;
let's try and put this together into a probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:24.880
statement to be discarded they have to be k g&nbsp;
off 250 so in other words the lower border would&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:35.000
be 250 - k and the upper border would be 250 +&nbsp;
k if we write this as a probability statement&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:43.080
we can see that this represents the probability&nbsp;
that X is within k g of 250 in other words it's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.960
the probability that the chip packets are not&nbsp;
discarded so if the probability that they're&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:57.960
discarded is 2% the probability that they're not&nbsp;
discarded must be 0.98 or 98% let's try and sketch&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:04.800
this distribution our mean is 250 and then we've&nbsp;
got this probability statement which says that the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:13.880
lower border Goes Down by K and the upper border&nbsp;
goes up by K so we can go k units up that way and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:21.800
K units down that way and that represents our&nbsp;
borders so this would be 250 take K and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:30.560
this would be 250 plus K we know that the area&nbsp;
between these two values is 0.9 so I'm going&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:40.320
to shade that area and we know that this area&nbsp;
is 0.98 now because we are given a area and we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:46.840
need to find the values we're going to be using&nbsp;
inverse normal so we go to inverse normal and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:57.640
first put our mean of 250 and standard deviation 4&nbsp;
the area is 0.98 and we can see that this area is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:05.080
symmetrical on either side of the mean so that's&nbsp;
when we can use a central tail note that if this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:10.520
wasn't symmetrical in other words if there's more&nbsp;
area on one side than there is on the other we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:16.360
wouldn't be able to use a central tail it has to&nbsp;
be the mean plus something and then the mean minus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:23.680
the same thing we can see that inverse normal&nbsp;
gives us two values the lower one being this one&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:34.360
which is 240.69 and then the upper one being this&nbsp;
one which is is 259.31 so now to find K we just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:41.040
take this one and we subtract 250 from it right&nbsp;
cuz we want to find this distance here so K is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:52.920
equal 25931 - 250 which is 9.31 let's try another&nbsp;
question which is still looking at quantiles but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:52.920 --> 00:11:00.720
this one is a little bit more difficult we have x&nbsp;
a normally distributed variable with mean 104 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:06.080
standard deviation 12 we are also given this&nbsp;
probability statement and we need to find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:12.640
value of K so let's start just by rewriting the&nbsp;
probability statement we know that the probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:24.360
that X is between 110 and K is equal to 0.1 since&nbsp;
we are given the probability and we have to find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:30.720
the value we know that we'll be using inverse&nbsp;
normal let's first sketch the distribution to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:39.640
get a better idea of what's going on we know that&nbsp;
the mean is 104 and let's try and Mark this area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:49.760
into the graph so we have the area between 110 and&nbsp;
K so let's just put 110 here somewhere above 104&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:56.600
and then we know that K must be above that so K&nbsp;
and I've tried to draw it so that the area between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:04.280
them is approximately equal to .1 or 10% of the&nbsp;
total area so we know that this shaded area is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:13.040
0.1 we know that we'll need to use inverse normal&nbsp;
because we're finding an unknown value however&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:21.640
with inverse normal we have to specify left tail&nbsp;
Central tail or right tail and this area doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:30.600
fit any of those three Tails so what we need to&nbsp;
do is add an area to this area to make it either&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:38.400
a left tail or a right tail I'll show you what I&nbsp;
mean if we add this green area here you can see&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:45.920
that the total combined area would now be a left&nbsp;
tail or if we add this yellow area here you can&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:53.400
see that the total combined area would be a right&nbsp;
tail looking at the graph we can see that this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:53.400 --> 00:13:01.640
green area is the area underneath 110 so therefore&nbsp;
or we can write the probability statement the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:09.760
probability that X is less than 110 and that&nbsp;
would represent this area in the same way this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:19.200
yellow area is the probability that X is greater&nbsp;
than K see because it's the area above K now using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:26.080
NCD on our calculator we can find this green area&nbsp;
but it wouldn't be very easy for us to find this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:32.440
yellow area because we don't know k so what we're&nbsp;
going to do is we're going to find this green area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:40.160
and then add it to the red area and that will give&nbsp;
us a left tail which we can then use to find K so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:47.600
using NCD on our calculator remember we're finding&nbsp;
this green area we put in our mean and standard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:55.760
deviation and then the lower value is 9999 and&nbsp;
the upper value is 110 remember we're finding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:55.760 --> 00:14:07.440
this area this gives us an area of 0.691 46 so&nbsp;
now that we know that this area is equal to 0.69&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:16.000
and this area is equal to 0.1 we know the total&nbsp;
area underneath K is equal to these two things&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:27.440
added together so we can write the probability&nbsp;
that X is less than K is equal to 0.69146 + 0.1&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:37.760
which is 0.79146 and now we can see that we can&nbsp;
use inverse normal to find K because the area we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:47.280
have has a left tail so opening inverse normal&nbsp;
we put our Tail as left the area is this total&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:55.320
area which is 0.79146 and then we already have the&nbsp;
mean and standard deviation from before this gives&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:55.320 --> 00:15:05.520
us a value of K is equal to 113.7 okay so let me&nbsp;
just summarise this type of question if we have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:13.200
an unknown value and the probability statement&nbsp;
gives us the probability between two values we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:20.720
first sketch it and then what we need to do is add&nbsp;
the area on one of the sides to make it either a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:28.840
left tail or a right tail and which area we add&nbsp;
will depend on which one is easier to find once&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:34.880
we've added those areas together we'll have a&nbsp;
left tail or a right tail and then we can just&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:42.040
use inverse normal to find the value let's try&nbsp;
another really similar question we have X which&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:47.520
is normally distributed and as I'm reading&nbsp;
the question I will write the distribution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:55.720
so X is approximately normal with mean 34 and&nbsp;
standard deviation 6.2 the probability that X is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:55.720 --> 00:16:06.520
between these two values is 30% so so we write the&nbsp;
probability that X is between K and 33 is 30% or&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:14.760
0.3 we need to find the value of K so once again&nbsp;
let's start by first sketching the distribution we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:24.680
know that the mean is 34 the probability statement&nbsp;
says that the area between K and 33 is about 3 so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:33.040
let's put those values on 33 is less than 34 so&nbsp;
I'll put it here and then I want to place K below&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:40.600
33 cuz you can see it's down here such that the&nbsp;
area between them this area here is about 30% so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:48.760
once again this shaded red area should be 0.3&nbsp;
now we can't use inverse normal yet because we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:55.960
don't have a left tail or a right tail but I can&nbsp;
see that we can add this area here to make it a&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:05.160
right tail looking at the graph this area is the&nbsp;
probability that X is above 33 because it's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:13.640
area which is above 33 right so this probability&nbsp;
is P that X is greater than 33 again the reason&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:18.800
that I'm adding this area to make it a right tail&nbsp;
rather than adding this area to make it a left&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:25.720
tail is because I can't find this area because we&nbsp;
don't know what K is so we first need to calculate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:33.720
the probability that X is greater than and 33 we&nbsp;
do this using NCD in our calculator so the lower&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:40.080
would be 33 the upper would be a really high&nbsp;
number and then the mean and standard deviation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:49.760
we put them in here and this gives us an area or&nbsp;
a probability of 0.5641 so if we know this area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:56.720
and we know this area we can add them together&nbsp;
to get the total area which is above K in other&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:04.080
words the probability that X is greater than K so&nbsp;
this is equal to the red Area 0.3 plus the green&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:13.760
area 0.5641 which is 0.8641 now we can use inverse&nbsp;
normal because we have a right tail where the area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:21.920
is 0.864 and the mean and standard deviation&nbsp;
are already in there to get K is equal to

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:31.440
27.19 okay so that's the end of quantiles after&nbsp;
watching this value you should be able to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:37.880
these two things firstly we need to be able&nbsp;
to find a value in the normal distribution&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:43.400
when we're given the probability remember that&nbsp;
this was done using inverse normal secondly was&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:48.720
that more difficult type of question where&nbsp;
we're given a probability statement between&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:55.600
two values and we need to find one of those&nbsp;
values remember that we did that by finding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:02.280
another area to either make it a left tail or&nbsp;
a right tail and then we can use inverse normal
