00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.680
For the next subtopic in continuous random&nbsp;
variables, we'll be looking at the normal&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:15.520
distribution. The normal distribution is a&nbsp;
special type of continuous random variable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:24.520
where the probability density function looks&nbsp;
like this. We call this a bell-shaped curve.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.440
The actual probability density function of the&nbsp;
normal distribution is something something like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:39.320
the form P(x) = e^-x^2 however we don't&nbsp;
actually need to know this in SACE stage&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.400
2 methods. Instead of using a function we think&nbsp;
about the normal distribution being controlled by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:55.840
two variables - those are the mean, which is the&nbsp;
middle of the bell-shaped curve (so here) and the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.160
standard deviation, which hopefully you remember&nbsp;
controls the spread of the data. So that's the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.080
standard deviation there. When a variable is&nbsp;
normally distributed, we have special notation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:16.800
we use to write that. It looks like this: x (being&nbsp;
the continuous random variable) is approximately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.640
normally distributed, and then within these&nbsp;
brackets, we write the mean and then the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.640
standard deviation squared. So let's say the time&nbsp;
I take to get to school is normally distributed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:36.640
with mean 30 and standard deviation 5 minutes we&nbsp;
would write that as: X is approximately normally&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:44.840
distributed with mean 30 and standard deviation 5&nbsp;
and then we write squared just for the notation.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:53.520
The standard deviation is still five not 25. Most&nbsp;
continuous random variables can be modelled using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.840
a normal distribution if we just set the mean and&nbsp;
the standard deviation to the appropriate values.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.400
This is because of two important properties of the&nbsp;
curve: firstly, the distribution is symmetrical&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:14.200
and most of the data is concentrated around the&nbsp;
mean, and secondly, as we approach the extremes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.080
(so this side and this side), the data becomes&nbsp;
less frequent. We can see that the example from&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:27.760
before fits both of these properties - if I were&nbsp;
to track the time it took me to get to school on&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.360
most days of the week it would usually be about 30&nbsp;
minutes so most of the data would be concentrated&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.560
around the mean it would be less likely that I&nbsp;
would take 45 minutes and equally less likely that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.840
I would take 15 minutes. So as we go towards&nbsp;
the extremes, the data becomes less frequent&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.280
therefore this continuous random variable can be&nbsp;
modelled using a normal distribution just as for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:03.960
any probability density function we represent&nbsp;
the the values on the x axis so if I wanted to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.960
find the probability of me making it to school&nbsp;
between 25 and 28 minutes I would draw that like&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:18.640
this with the values on the X axis and then the&nbsp;
probability is found as the area between these&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:27.960
two values so this green area would represent the&nbsp;
probability that X is between 25 and 28 minutes&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:35.640
to actually find this probability we can use our&nbsp;
calculator our calculator is able to calculate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:43.080
areas under the graph for the normal distribution&nbsp;
so in this case we would go to stat mode and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:53.040
press distribution normal and then NCD we can then&nbsp;
input our data so the lower and upper values are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:02.560
25 and 28 and then the mean is 30 and the standard&nbsp;
deviation is 5 and this gives us a probability of

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:11.920
0.859 I'll go through these steps in more detail&nbsp;
later when we do some practice questions together&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.200
there is one important property of the normal&nbsp;
distribution that we need to know and that is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:23.880
because it is symmetrical the mean is the same&nbsp;
as the median which is the same as the mode we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:31.320
can verify that by looking at the graph the mean&nbsp;
is here the median is also here because the area&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:39.200
on each side is 50% and the mode is here because&nbsp;
it is the highest value of probability let's do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:48.440
some example questions in the first one we have to&nbsp;
match normal distributions A and B to X and Y we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.720
can see from the graph that A and B have the same&nbsp;
mean remember we can find the mean by looking at&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:03.160
the midpoint of the normal distribution this makes&nbsp;
sense because X and Y both have mean 10 however&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.760
distribution a has a larger standard deviation&nbsp;
than distribution B we can see that because it is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:17.320
more spread out so therefore distribution a must&nbsp;
be X because X has a higher standard deviation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:25.400
three compared to the standard deviation of&nbsp;
Y which is two so a is X and B is y second&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:33.680
question we have a normally distributed variable&nbsp;
X with mean 10 and standard deviation 2 firstly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.880
we need to find the median so remember that for&nbsp;
normal distributions the mean median and mode are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:46.600
the same so the mean is going to be 10 and the&nbsp;
mode is also going to be 10 part C says find the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.960
approximate range this is a question which doesn't&nbsp;
show up very often in tests but the approximate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:01.840
range of a normal distribution is the mean plus&nbsp;
or minus three standard deviations this is because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:08.760
if we were to calculate this probability we would&nbsp;
find that it's equal to about 99.7% of all of the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:16.120
data it's not 100% because the true range of the&nbsp;
normal distribution is from negative Infinity to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.920
Infinity see here we can see that these arrows&nbsp;
go to negative infinity and positive Infinity&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:28.200
so in this case finding the lower bound of the&nbsp;
range we take 10 and we subtract three standard&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:38.160
deviations so 3 * 2 that's 10 - 6 which is 4 and&nbsp;
then to find the upper bound we find 10 plus three&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:45.760
standard deviations so that's 10 + 6 which is 16&nbsp;
then to find the range or the approximate range we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:53.280
just subtract these numbers so 16 - 4 is = 12 if&nbsp;
you want a visual representation of that it looks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:59.400
something like this so the mean is here and then&nbsp;
we've got one standard deviation on either side&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:08.720
two standard deviations on either side and then&nbsp;
three and then the approximate range would be this&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.800
okay now let's look at calculating probabilities&nbsp;
using the normal distribution so we've got the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.560
volume of petrol bought normally distributed&nbsp;
mean 36 and standard deviation 7 firstly find&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.440
the median and the mode so remember that the&nbsp;
median and the mode are always the same as the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:34.480
mean so these will both be 36 Part B says find the&nbsp;
percentage of customers who buy less than 28 L of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:40.640
petrol so when we're doing a normal distribution&nbsp;
question there's always three things that we need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:47.880
to do the first thing is that we need to define&nbsp;
the variable so we write let the volume of petrol&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:54.720
bought be X this is so that later when we use the&nbsp;
letter X the marker knows that we're referring to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:54.720 --> 00:08:02.120
the volume of petrol Bo secondly we need to State&nbsp;
the distribution so we say that X is approximately&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:10.160
normally distributed with mean 36 and standard&nbsp;
deviation 7 squared thirdly we need to write the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:17.840
probability statement so in this case we want the&nbsp;
percentage of customers who buy less than 28 l so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:25.520
each probability statement starts with a p and in&nbsp;
this case we want the volume of petrol bought to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:35.800
be less than 28 so we write X is less than 28 now&nbsp;
to calculate this probability we need to use our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:42.800
calculator for the normal distribution we press&nbsp;
stat mode and then press distribution and then&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:50.480
normal there's three options here and which one&nbsp;
we use depends on what we're trying to find so&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:58.640
NCD is when we are given the values and we need&nbsp;
to find the probability inverse normal is used&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:05.040
when we are given the probability and we want&nbsp;
to find the values so for this question let's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:10.480
draw it out you don't have to do this every time&nbsp;
but it makes it easier to visualise we know that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:18.360
the mean is 36 and the standard deviation is 7 we&nbsp;
want to find the probability that X is less than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:27.160
28 so we Mark 28 here and then we want to find&nbsp;
the probability that X is less than this value&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:33.160
so therefore we need to find the area underneath&nbsp;
this value we can see that in this case we are&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:41.560
given a value and we need to find the probability&nbsp;
so we are going to use NCD the stuff you put into&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:49.600
here is pretty self-explanatory so we put mean&nbsp;
is 36 and standard deviation is 7 now the lower&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:56.880
and the upper are the values on the lower bound&nbsp;
of this area and on the upper Bound in this case&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:05.240
we don't have a low bound so we're just going to&nbsp;
use a really low number so I just use 99999 and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:12.560
the upper bound is 28 then we press execute&nbsp;
this gives us a probability of approximately

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:21.320
0.127 let's do another question to save time&nbsp;
while I'm reading the question I like to define&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:28.040
the variable and write the distribution so we&nbsp;
read Marathon times are normally distributed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:38.400
therefore I can write let the marathon times b x&nbsp;
with mean 196 and standard deviation 24 so X is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:47.720
approximately normally distributed with mean&nbsp;
196 and standard deviation 24 part A we need&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:54.760
to find the probability that someone finishes in&nbsp;
exactly 3 hours so remember the third thing to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.760 --> 00:11:00.880
is write the probability statement so we always&nbsp;
start with a p and in this case we want X to be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:10.720
exactly 3 hours so X is equal to 180 just note&nbsp;
that I converted 3 hours into minutes because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:17.520
all of these units are in minutes now we can&nbsp;
use the calculator to find this if we want and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:25.040
in this case because X is equal to 180 we would&nbsp;
put both the lower and the upper to be 180 but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:31.720
remember this property for a continuous random&nbsp;
variable if we have a continuous random variable&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:39.200
which exactly equals a value the probability will&nbsp;
always be zero and that's because the area under&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:45.720
the curve for that straight line is going to be&nbsp;
zero Part B says find the probability that we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:51.200
finish in more than 3 hours so we've already&nbsp;
done these first two things and they're not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.600
changing for the question so we don't need to do&nbsp;
them again we just have to write the probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:04.840
statement always start with p and in this case&nbsp;
we want X to be more than 3 so X is greater than&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:11.040
180 I'm going to sketch the distribution to make&nbsp;
it easier to visualise although we don't have to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:20.320
do this every time so the mean is 196 standard&nbsp;
deviation 24 180 would be somewhere around here&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:26.360
and we want the probability that X is greater&nbsp;
than 180 so that's this upper area here now we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:34.040
use our calculator to find this probability so&nbsp;
because we have the values and we're finding&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:41.840
the area or the probability we use NCD the lower&nbsp;
bound in this case is 180 and the upper bound is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:48.760
infinity so we just put a really high number&nbsp;
like 99999 we put the mean in which is 196&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:57.120
and the standard deviation which is 24 this&nbsp;
gives us a probability of 0.747 part C says&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:03.600
find the probability we finish between between&nbsp;
164 and 187 minutes so we write the probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:13.040
statement we want X to be in between 164 and 187&nbsp;
again I'm going to draw the distribution just to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:22.480
make it easier to visualise so mean of 196 and&nbsp;
then we want it to be between 164 and 187 that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:28.360
would be this area here once again we are given&nbsp;
the values and we need to find the probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:35.360
or the area so we're using NCD the mean and the&nbsp;
standard deviation are already there from before&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:42.880
so we just need to put the lower as 164 and the&nbsp;
upper as 187 and this gives us a probability&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:51.760
of 0.26 so after watching this video you should&nbsp;
be able to do the following things describe why&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:58.320
most continuous random variables can be modelled&nbsp;
using the normal distribution secondly we need to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:04.160
know the properties of the normal distribution&nbsp;
including the mean median mode and approximate&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:10.480
range remember that the mean median and mode are&nbsp;
all the same and then the approximate range is&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:16.480
the mean plus or minus three standard deviations&nbsp;
finally and this is where most of the questions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:22.040
will come from we need to find probabilities&nbsp;
for the normal distribution when we are given&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:28.200
values remember that this was using NCD in&nbsp;
the calculator in the next video we'll look&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:34.440
at what when we are given probabilities and we&nbsp;
need to find the values that's called quantiles
